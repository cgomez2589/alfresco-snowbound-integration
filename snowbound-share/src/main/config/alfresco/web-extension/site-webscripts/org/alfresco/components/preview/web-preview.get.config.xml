      List of rule to decide which plugin that shall be used to preview the node's content or thumbnails.
      The list is evaluated from the top.
      All attributes for a condition must match.
      When a condition matches the nodes' mimeType and/or thumbails its list of plugins are tested from the top.
      Every plugin will be created and get an opportunity to decide if it may be used in the users browser environment.
      If the plugin can't be used it will give a report back to the user that will be displayed if neither of the
      plugins in the list can be used.
